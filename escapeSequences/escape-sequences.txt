Escape Sequence in C:
======================
Programming languages like C have escape sequences as a standard feature. 
They enable the inclusion of special characters and control patterns in strings
and character constants that are difficult to represent or write directly. 
In this blog post, we will explore escape sequences in C, their syntax, usage, and 
examples with matching outputs. Therefore, let's start this adventure to understanding escape sequences in C.

An escape sequence in the C programming language consists of a backslash () 
and a character that stands in for a special character or control sequence. 
During the compilation process, the C compiler substitutes any escape sequences it 
comes across with the relevant character or control sequence. It enables the use of 
difficult-to-represent characters like newlines, tabs, quotations, and backslashes.

It is composed of two or more characters starting with backslash \. For example: \n represents new line.
