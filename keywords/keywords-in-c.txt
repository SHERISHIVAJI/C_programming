Keywords in C:
================
Keywords in C are reserved words that have predefined meanings and are part of the C language syntax.
These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers within the 
program except for their intended purpose. They are used to define the structure flow and behavior of a C program.

The compiler recognizes a defined set of keywords in the C programming language. These keywords have specialized
purposes and play critical roles in establishing the logic and behavior of a program. Here are some characteristics 
of C keywords:

Reserved: 
----------
The C language reserves keywords are those keywords that cannot be used as identifiers in programs.
Using a keyword as a variable name or other identifier will cause a compilation error.

Predefined Meaning:
-------------------
Each keyword has a specific meaning that is assigned by the C language. These meanings are built into 
the C language's grammar and syntax and the compiler interprets them accordingly.

Specific Use:
-------------
Keywords are designed for specific purposes and contexts within the C language. They define control 
structures, data types, flow control, and other language constructs. Attempting to use a keyword outside 
of its intended purpose will result in a compilation error.

Standardized:
--------------
C language keywords are standardized across different compilers and implementations. 
It ensures the consistency and portability of C programs across different platforms and environments.
