Data Types in C:
=================
A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, character, etc.

Basic Data Types:
------------------
The basic data types are integer-based and floating-point based. C language supports both signed
and unsigned literals.

The memory size of the basic data types may change according to 32 or 64-bit operating system.

Int:
----
Integers are entire numbers without any fractional or decimal parts, and the int data type is used to 
represent them.

It is frequently applied to variables that include values, such as counts, indices, or other 
numerical numbers. The int data type may represent both positive and negative numbers because it 
is signed by default.

An int takes up 4 bytes of memory on most devices, allowing it to store values between around -2 
billion and +2 billion.

Char:
-----
Individual characters are represented by the char data type. Typically used to hold ASCII or UTF-8
encoding scheme characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, or commas. There are 256 characters
that can be represented by a single char, which takes up one byte of memory. Characters such as 'A', 
'b', '5', or '$' are enclosed in single quotes.

Float:
------
To represent integers, use the floating data type. Floating numbers can be used to represent fractional
units or numbers with decimal places.

The float type is usually used for variables that require very good precision but may not be very precise.
It can store values with an accuracy of about 6 decimal places and a range of about 3.4 x 1038 in 4 bytes 
of memory.

Double:
-------
Use two data types to represent two floating integers. When additional precision is needed, such as in 
scientific calculations or financial applications, it provides greater accuracy compared to float.

Double type, which uses 8 bytes of memory and has an accuracy of about 15 decimal places, yields larger values.
C treats floating point numbers as doubles by default if no explicit type is supplied.

int age = 25;  
char grade = 'A';  
float temperature = 98.6;  
double pi = 3.14159265359;
